My Final Project for Database (Basis Data) in 3rd Semester.

The project uses MongoDB as the database and includes 7 collection (folder) to manage various type of data, such as :
1. Fulltimer
2. Volunteer
3. Cameramen
4. Live Production
5. ICT
6. TS
7. Serving Schedule *(Jadwal Pelayanan)*

The project was inspired by my experience serving in Multimedia Ministry at my church. 
All data (names, birthdates, addresses, emails, nif, nij, cameras, computers, etc) are entirely fictional and were also inspired by those experience.

The project is developed using Java, runs on CLI, and requires only a minimal set of packages to install.
For further information, there is a report written in *Bahasa Indonesia* that you can read from.

Tbh, i wanted to upgrade the project to include GUI for better experience. But, due to deadline and other commitments, i wasn't able to do that.
